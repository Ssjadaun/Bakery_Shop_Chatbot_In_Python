Bakery Shop Chatbot in Python
Overview
This Python-based chatbot simulates a bakery shop assistant. It's designed to interact with customers, providing information about products, taking orders, and answering frequently asked questions. While this basic version uses simple text-based interactions, the foundation is laid for incorporating natural language processing (NLP) for more sophisticated conversations.
